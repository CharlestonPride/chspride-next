              On <strong>Saturday, June 17th, 2023 @ 9:00 am</strong> we are
              excited to celebrate Pride with our annual{" "}
              <strong>Pride Parade</strong> in historic Downtown Charleston!
              Whether you and your organization would like to join and walk in
              the parade, ride along in a vehicle, or create a unique themed
              float, all are welcome to take part in the festivities. If you
              have any questions about parade and float entries, please email{" "}
              <a href="mailto:parade@charlestonpride.org">
                parade@charlestonpride.org
              </a>
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-gradient text-info">Rules for the Parade</h3>
            <p>
              The person registering agrees that they have read the following
              waiver and represents the group, business or organization
              participating in the Charleston Pride Parade.
            </p>
            <ul className="text-left">
              <li>
                Floats must be secured and inspected for safety during transit.
              </li>
              <li>
                No items (including flowers, candy, beads, silly string etc.)
                may be thrown or given out from vehicles such as golf carts,
                miniature cars, motorcycles, or any other motorized vehicles.
                Candy or handouts must be given out by walkers who remain along
                the outer edge of the parade route.
              </li>
              <li>
                Groups will not purposefully stop to perform along the route;
                all participants must keep the parade moving. Gaps in the parade
                are a safety threat because they make spectators think the
                parade is over and then they begin to walk in the street.
              </li>
              <li>
                Riders on vehicles or floats cannot get on or off at any time
                during the parade.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the parade, all riders must be seated inside vehicles and
                cannot stand or ride on the hood or roof of a vehicle. Riders on
                floats must be seated unless there is a handrail available to
                safely use. Participants may ride in the back of pickup trucks,
                but the tailgate must be closed.
              </li>
              <li>
                The driver of the vehicle should be at least 18 years of age,
                possess a valid driverâ€™s license, and have proof of current
                automobile insurance. This will include all entries including
                support vehicles such as golf carts, miniature cars,
                motorcycles, and any other motorized vehicles.
              </li>
              <li>
                All vehicles will adhere to applicable state and city laws
                regarding safe vehicle operation and will be subject to citation
                for unlawful and unsafe acts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Motorcycles cannot rev their engines. Violators will be fined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Floats must clear 6 feet below street/traffic lights. Max.
                height is 11 feet. Please take the low hanging branches
                surrounding the staging area into consideration during your
                planning process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trash and debris must be cleaned up by your group, especially in
                the waiting areas prior to the start of the Parade.
              </li>
              <li>No nudity or inappropriate attire allowed.</li>
              <li>
                Parade participants should not engage with any protesters along
                the parade route.
              </li>
              <li>
                Parade event managers will distribute parade rules handout to
                each entry during line up of parade.
